title: Let's Go - First Meeting on 10/3/14
---

The results are in, and it's time to have our first meeting. We'll be getting together on **Friday, October 3rd** from **3:00-5:00 p.m.** in **[Hillhouse 17, Room 111](http://map.yale.edu/map/#building:HLH17)**. This is also the permanent meeting time for the group - at least for the semester. We'll go over the group's purpose, wax poetic about data science, get to know each other a bit, then jump into an activity. Can't wait to see you all there!

##FAQ
**Will I miss out on anything if I have to leave early?**</br>
*We're planning on front-loading the meeting, so probably not.*

**I don't have any experience with data science. Will I get left in the dust?**</br>
*Definitely not. We're a group for all levels of experience, and we're focused on education. The activities we have planned will suit toddlers and Leo Breiman (may he rest in peace) alike.*

**I spilled a hot beverage on my computer yesterday and won't have a replacement before the meeting. Should I come?**</br>
*Yes! The room we're in has a ton of workstations loaded with R, Python, and everything else you've ever dreamed of.*

**Will there be food/hot beverages?**</br>
*Probably.*
