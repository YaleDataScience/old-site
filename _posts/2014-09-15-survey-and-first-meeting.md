title: Survey and First Meeting 
---


In preparation for our inaugural meeting, we ask that you fill out a brief [survey](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/forms/d/1kLlXPVgHLrGOP87r1xqk_0nuT1f_yQphNacMwwzsftI/viewform?usp=send_form) so we can better sense how many people to expect as well as their background. Filling out the survey allows you to vote for the day(s) of the week that work best for you.

After reviewing submissions, we'll send out information about our first official meeting.

Feel free to contact us with any questions.
