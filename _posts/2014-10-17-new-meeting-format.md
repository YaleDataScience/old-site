title: New Meeting Format
---

Beginning with this week's meeting (October 17), we'll be introducing a new session format. The first hour or so will be devoted to boot camps and lessons, and the second will be for working on group projects and discussing individual ones.

We should be publishing a schedule of topics soon after we gather some more DATA (!!!), so look out for that. We'll also be announcing some speakers and special events soon, so stay tuned and get excited.

As always, if you have questions or feedback, shoot us an [email](yaledatascience@gmail.com)
.
