## The gang is back

Hello! In the following months, the Yale Data Science group will be back, and better than ever. We've entered
a new partnership with the upcoming Department of Statistics and Data Science, and there will be many
future collaborations to look forward to.

Until then, be sure to check out the new [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/YaleDataScience), as well as
the [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/524410961054701/), where you can fill out an attendance form so that we know who's interested and how much food to get! The winter info session will go over some advising on
what courses to enroll in next semester, as well as a brief preview to what the team has in store for everyone
next semester.

Until then, good luck with your final exams!
